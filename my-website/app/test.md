## Dear JetBrains Startups Team,

My name is **Heidi Albarazi**, and I’m currently completing my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at the **Technical University of Munich (TUM)**, where I’ll be starting my Master’s in **Human-Computer Interaction & Informatics** this year. I’m applying for the **Growth & Community Intern** position at **JetBrains for Startups** because it aligns perfectly with what I care most about: helping early-stage founders succeed, connecting communities, and shaping accessible support systems for tech entrepreneurs.

I have years of hands-on experience working with startup teams, organizing tech communities, and supporting both students and early-stage founders through mentorship, design, and event coordination. This role feels like a natural continuation of everything I’ve done so far — especially with my close relationship to JetBrains, both as a Campus Ambassador and as a current intern.

## 🧠 University & Technical Foundation

At TUM, my studies have covered a wide range of technical topics — from **Artificial Intelligence** and **3D User Interfaces** to **Data Visualization in R**, **Functional Programming**, and real-world development courses like **iPraktikum**, where I helped develop a full iOS app using **Scrum** and agile workflows. These courses gave me a strong foundation not only in software development, but also in **collaborative product design** — something I bring to every project and team I work with.

Currently, I’m finishing my Bachelor’s thesis titled **"SMARIOT – Elevating Elderly Independence through Smart Mirror, Augmented Reality, and IoT Technologies"** at the Chair of Augmented Reality. It’s a deeply user-centered project involving assistive tech and system design — showing how meaningful digital products can be built at the intersection of engineering, usability, and real-world needs.

## 💼 Working Experience & Entrepreneurial Skillset

I’ve worked across both design and development roles — from full-stack engineering to UI/UX design — always with a mindset of problem-solving and iteration.

- At **JetBrains**, I’m currently a **Software Engineering Research Intern**, developing a smart seminar system using **SvelteKit**, **Docker**, **Cloudflare**, and CI/CD pipelines. My responsibilities include full-stack development, unit testing, and maintaining code quality, while always keeping user experience in mind.
- As a **UI/UX Design Working Student at Toowoxx IT**, I conducted user testing, prototyping, and interface design for industry clients.
- I’ve also worked as a **Research Assistant at MELESSA LMU**, where I helped develop a Kotlin-based desktop application and coordinated socio-economic experiments in a behavioral lab.
- In parallel, I’ve been a **freelance UI/UX designer** since 2022, delivering design systems, prototypes, and websites for startup clients in health, lifestyle, and productivity sectors.

These experiences helped me understand how early-stage teams work: their speed, their need for adaptability, and their limited resources. I’ve always approached projects with a builder mindset — asking what users actually need, and figuring out how to get there fast without compromising quality.

## 🎓 Engagement in Student Clubs & Startup Communities

Beyond academics, I’ve been highly engaged in **student-led entrepreneurship** and tech communities:

- At **TUM.ai**, I supported the **E-Lab** incubator, contributed to the design of their website, and helped early-stage AI-based startups develop their first prototypes.
- As a long-time member  at **TEG (The Entrepreneurial Group)**, I organized pre-incubator sessions, mentored startup teams, and facilitated design workshops using **Figma**.
- I’m also actively involved in **roboTUM**, contributing to both technical and organizational efforts within the robotics space.

These student groups gave me firsthand experience in building initiatives from scratch, supporting founders through the earliest steps, and understanding what students and builders need to succeed. They also taught me how to work across disciplines — from product to marketing to community.

## 🤝 Networking Events & Innovation Programs

I’ve never just stayed inside the classroom — I constantly seek out opportunities to connect, learn, and contribute. I’ve attended events by **UnternehmerTUM**, **AI+ Munich**, **The Pool**, and regularly join **START Munich** meetups. I’ve also participated in over **20 hackathons**, with **10+ wins**, many focused on AI, sustainability, or inclusive tech. These include:

- **Cassini Hack** – Frontend for real-time population tracking via satellite.
- **TUM.ai Makeathon** – AI-based Chrome extension for detecting gender bias in language.
- **Immersive XR Hack** – Created an AR escape game inside a planetarium dome.

I also co-founded **Code & Chill**, a meetup that brings students, developers, and side project teams together to collaborate, share ideas, or just get help. It started as a small gathering and turned into a thriving micro-community.

I’m part of **2hearts**, a global entrepreneurial network for people with multicultural backgrounds, where I continue to grow both personally and professionally.

These experiences taught me how to **build trust in a community**, how to identify what people actually need, and how to turn that into real engagement — whether through events, content, or partnerships.

## 🌟 My Work at JetBrains

### As Campus Ambassador (2023–2024)
During my time as a **JetBrains Campus Ambassador**, I was the go-to person for students wanting to learn more about JetBrains products. I:

- Organized and hosted sessions on **IntelliJ**, **PyCharm**, and other tools.
- Represented JetBrains at **HackaTUM**, **ICOM**, and at career fairs like **RWTH Aachen**.
- Promoted internship programs and tools directly to university communities.
- Represented JetBrains at international events like **Women in STEM Amsterdam**, where I connected with peers across Europe.

I wasn’t just promoting products — I was creating entry points into a larger ecosystem. I enjoyed every part of it: planning, presenting, connecting, and answering questions. It felt rewarding to see how even small interventions (like showing someone a plugin they didn’t know existed) could make someone’s work easier or better.

### As Software Engineering Research Intern (2024–)
Now, as an intern, I’m contributing directly to JetBrains' internal tech — but always with a strong user and product lens. The experience has strengthened my technical skills and shown me how research, engineering, and usability intersect in a fast-moving team. I would love to continue building on that foundation by helping shape JetBrains’ startup outreach and ecosystem development.

## 🙌 Why This Role Is a Natural Fit

I’m applying for this role not just because I’ve done similar things before, but because I care deeply about the **startup ecosystem** — especially at the earliest stages. I know how much energy, uncertainty, and potential those early moments hold, and I want to help founders make the most of them.

I bring:
- **Hands-on startup experience**
- A strong **technical and design background**
- Years of **community engagement and mentoring**
- An understanding of **how to build and scale meaningful partnerships**
- And above all, a lot of **curiosity, reliability, and care** for the people I work with

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I’d be genuinely excited to bring my energy, experience, and network to the JetBrains for Startups team and help shape the next phase of your global community.

Best regards,
